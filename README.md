# When_Zombies_Attack
Cellular Automata &amp; Multi-Threaded Programming

Using C Programming, this project was built for the purposes
of simulating a zombie apocolypse based on the rules of 
Cellular Automata. 

There are three different models and each have a serial and parallelised equivelent,
the purpose of this was to explore the advantages of efficient multi-threaded programming.
